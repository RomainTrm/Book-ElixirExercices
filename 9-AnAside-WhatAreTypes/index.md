# 9. An aside - What are types?

Keep in mind we have two "layers" in Elixir types:  

- Implementation: primitive types associated together, for example a list of values.
- Abstractions: an associated module to provide complex behaviors, like the `List` module

For example, the `Keyword` module manipulate a list of tuples.
